EXP10
- test the model generalization ability
- remove deleteparams function from preprocess.py
- add deleteparam functoin to training.py
- adjust delete param in dev_utils.py

1. Predict on only one output

Note: 
- cuss_loss4 lead to inf loss value (suspect the gradient vanishing)
- Using SGD intorduce overshoot gradient problem which make loss to NaN
- Using SGD take a hugh amount of time to converge compare to Nadam
- Change to RMSProp instead

To-do
- preprocess using ceptral normalization https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/discussion/54082
